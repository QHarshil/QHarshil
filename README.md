# Harshil Chudasama

Full-stack engineer with depth in backend systems, ML infrastructure, and distributed applications. I build end-to-end: React interfaces, Python/Java services, and the infrastructure underneath: microservices, search systems, model serving, and real-time data pipelines.

MSCS (AI/ML) | Open to SWE roles (Backend, Full-Stack, MLE, Platform, ML Systems)
