# 🧠 Harshil Chudasama

**Software Engineer** with a strong bias toward **systems that ship**: scalable backends, distributed services, and ML-powered products.  
I’m not trying to silo myself — I’m open to **general SWE roles** (backend, full-stack, platform, infra), with a **current focus** on search/ranking + performance + reliability.

🎓 MSCS (AI/ML) Candidate

---

## 🔭 Current Focus (without limiting my options)
- **Search & Ranking:** vector retrieval, hybrid scoring (lexical + vector), eval loops (MRR/NDCG)
- **Backend & Distributed Systems:** event-driven services, data modeling, caching, correctness under concurrency
- **Reliability & Performance:** metrics, health checks, fallbacks, load testing, tail-latency awareness
