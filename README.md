Building resilient backend platforms and AI-powered products that balance performance, reliability, and user impact.
ðŸŽ“ MSCS (AI/ML)
ðŸ’¡ At the intersection of backend infrastructure, ML systems, and product innovation.

- **Portfolio**: [qharshil.ca](https://qharshil.ca)

## Focus Areas
- **System design & distributed systems**: data pipelines with strong SLAs (p95/p99, availability).
- **ML platforms, inference, and search infra**: ONNX/Core ML pipelines, embeddings, hybrid retrieval.
- **Platform/DX**: feature flags, rollout safety, observability used to ship faster.
- **Optimization and performance**: profiling, caching, batching, async/queueing, backpressure.
- **Full-stack product engineering** when it drives user impact (TypeScript/React).

## Areas I Care About
- **Idempotency** across flows so retries are safe and predictable.
- **Retries & circuit breakers** tuned for graceful degradation under failure.
- **Backpressure** patterns that shield critical services from overload.
- **Consistency models** aligned with business semantics and user trust.
- **Cost vs. performance trade-offs** informed by observability and load tests.

## Featured Projects
- **[Full-Stack CRM - Event and Donor Management](https://github.com/QHarshil/Full-Stack-CRM---Events-and-Donor-Management)** | `NestJS`, `React`, `TypeORM`, `Socket.IO`, `PostgreSQL`: Donor operations suite with multi-criteria matching, real-time fundraising dashboards, role-aware access, and compliance-grade audit logging that trimmed vetting time **40%**.
- **[Commerce Services](https://github.com/QHarshil/Commerce-Services)** | `Spring Boot`, `Kafka`, `Redis`, `Kubernetes`: Transactional microservices with outbox/SAGA patterns; checkout **p95 under 300 ms** and **zero-downtime** deploys across REST and gRPC.
- **[FeatureFlagX](https://github.com/QHarshil/FeatureFlagX)** | `Java`, `Spring Boot`, `PostgreSQL`, `Redis`: Flag evaluations **under 10 ms** with SDKs for Java/Python/TypeScript; rollout targeting, kill switches, audit trails, health and metrics endpoints.
- **[TaskRouterX](https://github.com/QHarshil/TaskRouterX)** | `FastAPI`, `Python`, `SQLite`: **Cost-aware task routing** with pluggable schedulers, live dashboard, synthetic load generator, and pytest coverage.
- **[FaceFit AR](https://github.com/QHarshil/FaceFit-AR-Based-Virtual-Accessory-Try-On)** | `Computer Vision`, `Three.js`, `React.js`, `Node.js`: Browser-based eyewear try-on. It integrates MediaPipe Face Mesh for dense 3D facial landmark extraction with a Three.js rendering pipeline that places GLB eyewear models directly onto the user video stream.

## Wins & Highlights
- **IMC Prosperity 2 Global Trading Competition** - Ranked **87/13,500**; **12th in Canada**.
- **Microsoft x Qualcomm On-Device AI Hackathon** - **1st place** for a Snapdragon-powered wheelchair navigation assistant (`YOLOv8`, `ONNX`, `Grok LLM`).
- **Graduate TA** - Led algorithms and data structures labs for 100+ students; coached debugging and complexity thinking.

## Core Toolkit
- **Languages**: Java, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, C++.
- **Backend & Data**: Spring Boot, FastAPI, Flask, NestJS, Express, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch.
- **Cloud & Ops**: AWS (Lambda, ECS, S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis), Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Grafana, Prometheus.
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, ONNX, OpenCV.
