# 🧠 Harshil Chudasama

Building resilient backend platforms and AI-powered products that balance performance, reliability, and user impact.
🎓 MSCS (AI/ML)
💡 At the intersection of backend infrastructure, ML systems, and product innovation.

- **Portfolio**: [qharshil.ca](https://qharshil.ca)

## Focus Areas
- **System design & distributed systems**: data pipelines with strong SLAs (p95/p99, availability).
- **ML platforms, inference, and search infra**: ONNX/Core ML pipelines, embeddings, hybrid retrieval.
- **Platform/DX**: feature flags, rollout safety, observability used to ship faster.
- **Optimization and performance**: profiling, caching, batching, async/queueing, backpressure.
- **Full-stack product engineering** when it drives user impact (TypeScript/React).

## Areas I Care About
- **Idempotency** across flows so retries are safe and predictable.
- **Retries & circuit breakers** tuned for graceful degradation under failure.
- **Backpressure** patterns that shield critical services from overload.
- **Consistency models** aligned with business semantics and user trust.
- **Cost vs. performance trade-offs** informed by observability and load tests.

## Featured Projects
- **[Anytime-Inference - ML-Model-Serving](https://github.com/QHarshil/Anytime-Inference---ML-Model-Serving)** | `Python`, `Pytorch`, `HuggingFace`, `Machine Learning`: Cascade-based planner that jointly optimizes model variant, quantization, batch size, and device selection to meet latency deadlines while maximizing task accuracy. The system profiles configurations offline and selects optimal settings at runtime based on deadline constraints.
- **[Commerce Services](https://github.com/QHarshil/Commerce-Services)** | `Spring Boot`, `Kafka`, `Redis`, `Kubernetes`: Transactional microservices with outbox/SAGA patterns; checkout **p95 under 300 ms** and **zero-downtime** deploys across REST and gRPC.
- **[FeatureFlagX](https://github.com/QHarshil/FeatureFlagX)** | `Java`, `Spring Boot`, `PostgreSQL`, `Redis`: Flag evaluations **under 10 ms** with SDKs for Java/Python/TypeScript; rollout targeting, kill switches, audit trails, health and metrics endpoints.
- **[FaceFit AR](https://github.com/QHarshil/FaceFit-AR-Based-Virtual-Accessory-Try-On)** | `Computer Vision`, `Three.js`, `React.js`, `Node.js`: Browser-based eyewear try-on. It integrates MediaPipe Face Mesh for dense 3D facial landmark extraction with a Three.js rendering pipeline that places GLB eyewear models directly onto the user video stream.
- **[Full-Stack CRM - Event and Donor Management](https://github.com/QHarshil/Full-Stack-CRM---Events-and-Donor-Management)** | `NestJS`, `React`, `TypeORM`, `Socket.IO`, `PostgreSQL`: Donor operations suite with multi-criteria matching, real-time fundraising dashboards, role-aware access, and compliance-grade audit logging that trimmed vetting time **40%**.
- **[TaskRouterX](https://github.com/QHarshil/TaskRouterX)** | `FastAPI`, `Python`, `SQLite`: **Cost-aware task routing** with pluggable schedulers, live dashboard, synthetic load generator, and pytest coverage.

## Wins & Highlights
- **IMC Prosperity 2 Global Trading Competition** - Ranked **87/13,500**; **12th in Canada**.
- **Microsoft x Qualcomm On-Device AI Hackathon** - **1st place** for a Snapdragon-powered wheelchair navigation assistant (`YOLOv8`, `ONNX`, `Grok LLM`).
- **Graduate TA** - Led algorithms and data structures labs for 100+ students; coached debugging and complexity thinking.

## Core Toolkit
- **Languages**: Java, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, C++.
- **Backend & Data**: Spring Boot, FastAPI, Flask, NestJS, Express, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch.
- **Cloud & Ops**: AWS (Lambda, ECS, S3, DynamoDB, Kinesis), Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Grafana, Prometheus.
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, ONNX, OpenCV.
